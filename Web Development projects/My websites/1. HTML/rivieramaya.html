  <h2>Some interesting facts</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>The world’s two largest underground rivers are found in the Riviera Maya</strong>, measuring more than 435 miles, according to the Quintana Roo Speleological Society (QRSS).Also called “cenotes”, these underground rivers were formed by thousands of years of dripping rain water upon the subsoil’s calcareous rock, forming vast fresh water rivers and epic stalagmites and stalactites. The cenotes were sacred spaces for the Maya and an essential source of fresh water. Over the years, archeologists have found Mayan remnants in the cenotes, including jewelry and human remains. A snorkeler’s dream, visitors can access these magnificent mazes from Cozumel and Isla Mujeres with the aid of a tour guide.</p></li>
    
    <li><p> Before Cancun rose to fame in the 90’s, divers, explorers, archeologists and treasure hunters from around the world had been visiting the Riviera Maya since the 60’s.</p></li>
    
    <li><p> Before 1999, the Riviera Maya was referred to as the Cancun-Tulum corridor. The term “Riviera Maya” was developed in 1999 by the municipal president at the time, Miguel Ramon Martin Azueta. Now, Riviera Maya refers to the tourism district stretching from Puerto Morelos to Punta Allen in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, and includes popular destinations like Playa del Carmen, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulum">Tulum</a> and <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozumel">Cozumel</a>.</p></li>
